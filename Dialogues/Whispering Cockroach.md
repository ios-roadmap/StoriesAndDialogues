---

## Scene 1 – Back‑stage corridor, thirty minutes before auditions
**Alex:** *[pacing]* I can’t remember my lines. They sound dreadful, sentimental and—honestly—kind of wooden.  
**Jamie:** Hey, cheer up, you look really sad. You’d **better rehearse the first beat again**; the rest will flow.  
**Alex:** But the whole monologue feels quirky when it should be tragic.  
**Jamie:** If I were you, I’d **take a deep breath and slow each sentence**. You **ought to** trust the work you’ve done all week.  
**Alex:** I’m not convinced. What if Taylor hates it?  
**Jamie:** Why don’t you **visualise a full house applauding**? There’s no need to worry—we’ll figure this out.  
**Alex:** Suppose I blank on stage?  
**Jamie:** You shouldn’t give up on yourself before you start. Have you thought about marking the emotional peaks with a tiny pencil dot?  
**Alex:** Clever. *[smiles weakly]* What do you think about the last line?  
**Jamie:** I completely agree with everything you’ve said about its importance. I wasn’t sure at first but now I’m with you—it’s the soul of the piece.  
**Alex:** Really?  
**Jamie:** Same opinion that Taylor has, actually. He told me yesterday your final beat was “creepy in the best way.”  
**Alex:** *[laughs]* Creepy?  
**Jamie:** In a good, cockroach‑under‑the‑floorboards sense—memorable.  
**Alex:** That’s… bizarrely reassuring.  
**Jamie:** I promise you things will get easier soon. Don’t blame yourself for nerves. Everyone shakes the first time.  
**Alex:** *[exhales]* Okay. But if I fall apart—  
**Jamie:** I’m not going to let you give up. Cheer up, mate; we’ll get you that part.  

---

## Scene 2 – On stage, right after the audition
**Taylor:** Solid read, Alex. Your pacing was tight.  
**Alex:** *[whispers to Jamie]* I stumbled on the third sentence.  
**Jamie:** Oh, that’s too bad, but everything will be fine. From where I sat, it **didn’t lack originality** at all.  
**Taylor:** Indeed. I totally agree with Jamie. I was wrong—you were right about everything in rehearsal; the softer tempo landed harder.  
**Alex:** Wait—you’re in complete agreement?  
**Taylor:** Absolutely. If I were you, **I would celebrate tonight**.  
**Alex:** *[blinks]* I… wow.  
**Taylor:** By the way, skip the nervous pacing in future; your energy’s stronger when you start still. *If I were you I’d skip it.*  
**Alex:** Point taken. Thank you.  

---

## Scene 3 – Café across the street, later that evening
**Mia:** Bro, the chemistry final is tomorrow and I’m doomed.  
**Alex:** You shouldn’t catastrophise. Everything will be okay.  
**Mia:** Easy for you to say—you just crushed an audition.  
**Jamie:** Mia, can I talk you out of pulling an all‑nighter? You **ought to** rest; retention drops after midnight.  
**Mia:** If I were you, I would cram till sunrise.  
**Dr Rowan:** *[joining]* Actually, Mia, why don’t you **review only the key reactions, then sleep**? Your hippocampus needs REM.  
**Mia:** Have you thought about the fact my grade is 48 % of the term mark?  
**Dr Rowan:** I have—and I still stand by my advice. Don’t worry, you’ll be great.  
**Mia:** What do you think, Alex?  
**Alex:** Same opinion that Dr Rowan just voiced. I totally agree. I wasn’t sure at first, but now I’m with you—sleep trumps blind panic.  
**Mia:** I guess there’s no need to worry; we’ll figure this out together.  
**Jamie:** Exactly. I’m not going to let you give up on your dream of med school.  
**Dr Rowan:** And remember, dreadful grades don’t define you. Sentimental as it sounds, resilience does.  
**Mia:** *[smiles]* Thanks, everyone. I feel less tragic already.  
**Alex:** Everything will be okay, sis.  

---

## Scene 4 – Park bench, next morning
**Jamie:** How’s the stomach?  
**Alex:** Surprisingly calm. I keep replaying Taylor’s compliment—it was so validating.  
**Jamie:** See? I told you yesterday.  
**Alex:** True. I was wrong; you were right about everything.  
**Jamie:** *[grins]* Not everything—but on the big stuff, maybe.  
**Alex:** You know, you ought to become a life coach.  
**Jamie:** If I were you, I’d skip the flattery and buy me a pastry.  
**Alex:** Deal. But seriously—thank you.  
**Jamie:** Anytime. And if you start doubting again, remember: you’d better text me before you spiral.  
**Alex:** I will.  

---

## Scene 5 – University hallway, after Mia’s exam
**Mia:** Guys! I think it went well.  
**Jamie:** Fantastic! Hey, cheer up—you look relieved but exhausted.  
**Mia:** I’m relieved *and* exhausted. *[laughs]* But I remembered everything we reviewed.  
**Dr Rowan:** I completely agree with your smile: it says confidence.  
**Mia:** I wasn’t sure at first, but now I’m with you—sleep was the right move.  
**Alex:** Told you so.  
**Mia:** You were right about everything.  
**Jamie:** Group selfie to mark the occasion?  
**Alex:** Why not? And afterwards, pastries all round.  
**Dr Rowan:** Clever idea. What do you think, Mia?  
**Mia:** Same opinion that Jamie just expressed: **YES**.  
**Jamie:** Then let’s go. Everything will be okay—and currently, everything *is*.  

---

## Scene 6 – Community‑theatre stage, three weeks later, first full run‑through
**Alex:** *[glancing at script]* Taylor added a new soliloquy. The words feel jumbled—quirky when they ought to be tragic and borderline wooden.  
**Jamie:** If I were you, I’d **mark the beats in the margin** right now. There’s no need to worry; we’ll figure this out.  
**Alex:** But the new section mentions a cockroach crawling across the cradle—creepy symbolism, indeed.  
**Jamie:** Dreadful image, sure, yet clever. You should **lean into the discomfort**.  
**Alex:** What do you think about cutting it?  
**Taylor:** *[appearing]* Can I talk you out of it? The cockroach stays.  
**Alex:** I totally agree it’s vivid; I wasn’t sure at first but now I’m with you.  
**Jamie:** Same opinion that Taylor’s got.  
**Taylor:** And Alex, you’d better **trust your instincts**. Your melancholy vibe nailed rehearsal yesterday.  
**Alex:** Still, my timing is off.  
**Jamie:** You shouldn’t give up. I’m not going to let you. Everything will be okay.  
**Taylor:** Right—places. Five‑minute call!  

---

## Scene 7 – Green‑room sofa, post‑run‑through
**Alex:** *[head in hands]* That final tableau felt… empty. It didn’t lack originality, but the pacing—ugh.  
**Jamie:** Ooh, that’s too bad, but everything will be fine. Have you thought about **dropping the mic‑stand lean** and staying centre?  
**Alex:** If I were you, I’d skip it?  
**Jamie:** Exactly. And why don’t you **let the silence hang two extra beats** before lights out?  
**Taylor:** I completely agree with everything you’ve said, Jamie. I’m in complete agreement.  
**Alex:** Alright, I’ll try. But what if the audience doesn’t get the metaphor?  
**Jamie:** Don’t blame yourself for their interpretations.  
**Alex:** Easy for you to say.  
**Jamie:** Hey, cheer up—you look really sad. You need to cheer up and trust the craft.  
**Alex:** I promise I’ll keep at it.  

---

## Scene 8 – Library café, weekend revision session
**Mia:** *[spreading cards]* Organic chemistry again—tragic.  
**Alex:** Everything will be okay. If I were you, I’d **chunk topics into thirty‑minute sprints**.  
**Mia:** I ought to, but the material still feels wooden and dense.  
**Dr Rowan:** *[arriving with tea]* Have you thought about **teaching the reactions aloud**? Explaining forces consolidation.  
**Mia:** What do you think, Jamie?  
**Jamie:** I totally agree. And if I were you, I would **record voice notes**; listening back reinforces memory.  
**Mia:** There’s no need to worry—yes, I’m repeating it to convince myself.  
**Dr Rowan:** Indeed. And remember, dreadful practice sessions precede delightful breakthroughs.  
**Mia:** Thanks. I’m not going to let myself give up.  

---

## Scene 9 – Agency office, the following Monday
**Riley (Talent Agent):** Alex, showcase slots are tight. Why don’t you **highlight the eerie humour** in your piece? Excess gloom can repel casting panels.  
**Alex:** If I were you, **you’d want levity?**  
**Riley:** Correct. You should **hone a wink of irony** when mentioning the floorboards’ cockroach; it’s creepy but quirky.  
**Alex:** I completely agree with your business view, but Taylor wrote it bleak.  
**Riley:** I wasn’t sure at first but now I’m with you—balance it. There’s no need to worry; we’ll figure this out and submit a winning tape.  
**Alex:** Suppose I can’t pivot tonally in time?  
**Riley:** I’m not going to let you give up. We shoot Thursday.  
**Alex:** Dreadful deadline—but I promise I’ll adjust.  
**Riley:** Cheer up, mate—you’ll book roles beyond this if you nail it.  

---

## Scene 10 – Open‑air rehearsal, dusk before filming
**Jamie:** Wind’s up; pages keep flapping.  
**Alex:** It mirrors my nerves.  
**Jamie:** You ought to **clip the script to a board**. Save head‑space for delivery.  
**Alex:** If I pause too long after the cockroach line, is that wooden?  
**Jamie:** Not at all. If I were you, I’d skip the unnecessary hand gesture instead.  
**Taylor:** Same opinion that Jamie just shared. *[to Jamie]* I totally agree.  
**Alex:** I was wrong; you were right about everything timing‑wise.  
**Taylor:** Good. Then let’s run it.  
*(They rehearse—Alex lands every beat.)*  
**Jamie:** See? Don’t worry—you’ll be great.  
**Alex:** Everything will be okay.  

---

## Scene 11 – Recording studio, showcase filming day
**Camera Op:** Sound speed. Slate: *Mid‑winter Cockroach, take one.*  
**Alex:** *[performs, fragile but fierce]*  
**Riley:** *[whispers to Jamie]* What do you think?  
**Jamie:** I completely agree it’s strong. The irony lands.  
**Riley:** I wasn’t sure at first but now I’m with you—this is the tape.  
*(Take finishes.)*  
**Camera Op:** Beautiful.  
**Alex:** Was it dreadful in a good way?  
**Riley:** Indeed. Clever, creepy, and tragically human.  
**Alex:** *[exhales]* If I were you, I’d skip take two?  
**Riley:** We’ll bank it. Let’s move on.  

---

## Scene 12 – University bulletin board, results day
**Mia:** *[eyes wide]* I PASSED!  
**Jamie:** Woo! Hey, cheer up—well, cheer louder!  
**Mia:** I got an 83. I totally agree with your study‑plan gospel now.  
**Dr Rowan:** I was wrong—you were right about everything sleep‑related, Jamie.  
**Mia:** I promise things will get easier soon—no more organic exams.  
**Alex:** There’s no need to worry about next semester; you’ll rock it.  
**Mia:** Don’t blame yourself for my previous meltdowns—thanks for the rescue.  
**Jamie:** Same opinion that everyone shares: you earned this. Pastries?  
**All:** Pastries.  

---

## Scene 13 – Small‑town theatre, opening night of the play
**Back‑stage**  
**Alex:** Audience sounds big.  
**Jamie:** Dreadful big or delightful big?  
**Alex:** Both. Sentimental relatives, quirky critics, tragic ex‑classmates—  
**Jamie:** If I were you, I’d skip categorising them. Focus on the work.  
**Taylor:** There’s no need to worry, we’ll figure the crowd energy out. You ought to **ride their silence**.  
**Alex:** *[hands trembling]* What if I freeze?  
**Jamie:** I’m not going to let you give up. Breathe in four, hold four, out four. You’ve got this.  
**Taylor:** Also, I totally agree: keep the centre‑stage stillness we rehearsed.  
*(Stage Manager calls places.)*  
**Alex:** Everything will be okay.  
**Jamie:** You’re great. Go prove it.  

---

## Scene 14 – On stage, mid‑performance
*(Monologue reaches cockroach image. A phone dings in the audience.)*

---

**Alex:** *[bowing, teary]*  
**Jamie:** *[from wings]* Cheer up, mate—you just owned that part!  
**Taylor:** I completely agree with everything the ovation’s saying.  
**Alex:** I was so sure I’d stumble.  
**Taylor:** You were wrong; we were right about your talent.  

---

## Scene 16 – Lobby mingle, post‑show
**Critic Nora:** Alex, that stop‑motion hush after the cockroach line—ingenious.  
**Alex:** Thank you. I wasn’t sure at first but—  
**Nora:** Now I’m with you. It **didn’t lack originality** one bit.  
**Alex:** High praise!  
**Jamie:** *[aside]* Indeed. And tomorrow’s paper will spread the word.  
**Nora:** Already drafting: “A clever, creepy meditation on regret.”  
**Alex:** Dreadful good headline.  

---

## Scene 17 – Rooftop bar, cast after‑party
**Mia:** *[hugging Alex]* Brother of the year!  
**Riley:** Scouts from Off‑Broadway emailed me.  
**Alex:** What do you think of that, Jamie?  
**Jamie:** Same opinion that we toast immediately.  
**Taylor:** If I were you I’d skip the cheap bubbly—order something decent.  
**Jamie:** You should **celebrate properly**.  
**Alex:** I’m in complete agreement. But first, a word: thank you all. I promise I’ll remember tonight when things get hard again.  
**Jamie:** Things will get easier soon, harder again, easier again … the cycle.  
**Alex:** There’s no need to worry – we’ll figure it out.  
*(They clink glasses against neon skyline.)*  

---

## Scene 18 – Rainy morning, two months later, rehearsal for New York transfer
**Alex:** The revised script doubled my lines—tragic!  
**Jamie:** If I were you, I’d skip panic and **break them into chunks**.  
**Alex:** You’re right. Still, the new director wants more sentimentality, less quirk.  
**Jamie:** Have you thought about **layering subtle humour beneath the sorrow**?  
**Alex:** I ought to. But I’m tired.  
**Jamie:** You need to cheer up; coffee?  
**Alex:** Please.  
**Jamie:** There’s no need to worry—we’ll figure this out. I’m not going to let you give up.  

---

## Scene 19 – Rehearsal hall, mid‑tech
**New Director (Sam):** Alex, why don’t you **underline the cockroach gesture with a faint smile**? Juxtaposition heightens unease.  
**Alex:** I completely agree with everything you’ve said—smart note.  
**Sam:** Good. And if I were you, I would **soften the mid‑sentence growl**; too wooden otherwise.  
**Alex:** Understood.  
**Sam:** Also, have you thought about shaving two words from line four? Flows better.  
**Alex:** Same opinion that, yes, trimming helps.  
**Jamie:** *[watching]* Brilliant.

**Sam:** Don’t worry—you’ll be great. Everything will be okay.  

---

## Scene 20 – Off‑Broadway preview, storm outside
*(Power flickers; crew anxious.)*  
**Stage Manager:** Generator might cut; actors stay calm.  
**Alex:** Dreadful timing.  
**Jamie:** If I were you I’d skip fretting; audience loves live chaos stories.  
**Taylor:** I totally agree. Let’s treat blackout as found theatre.  
**Alex:** Okay, but if my spotlight dies—  
**Jamie:** I’m not going to let you give up. Project your voice; candlelight if we must.  
**Stage Manager:** Ten minutes!  
**Alex:** There’s no need to worry—we’ll figure it out.  

*(The power indeed flickers mid‑show; Alex lights a prop lantern, finishes the monologue by glow—audience erupts.)*  

---

## Scene 21 – Newspaper stand next morning
**Alex:** *[reads headline]* “Lantern‑lit Cockroach Triumph.”  
**Jamie:** It **didn’t lack opriginality**—spelled wrong but glowing review.  
**Alex:** *[laughs]* Dreadful typo, clever pun?  
**Jamie:** Indeed. What do you think about framing it?  
**Alex:** Same opinion that I frame the clipping.  
**Jamie:** And you’d better call your mum.  
**Alex:** Already dialling.  

---

## Scene 22 – University quad, later that week
**Mia:** Guess who got accepted into the summer research lab?  
**Alex:** You!  
**Mia:** Yes. If I were you, I’d skip modesty—I’m proud.

**Mia:** There’s no need to worry about tuition; stipend covers it.  
**Alex:** Everything will be okay—and fantastic.  
**Jamie:** Pastries again?  
**All:** Pastries!  

---

## Scene 23 – Quiet riverbank, sunset epilogue
**Alex:** *[watching water]* Hard to believe the anxious wreck from months ago.  
**Jamie:** You were anxious; I gave moral support. Story tracks.  
**Alex:** I was wrong; you were right about everything—breathing, pacing, cockroaches…  
**Jamie:** I wasn’t right about pastry counts—we’ve eaten too many.  
**Alex:** *[laughs]* If I were you, I’d skip counting calories.  
**Jamie:** Same opinion that life’s short—enjoy.  
**Alex:** Have you thought about writing a guidebook for worriers?  
**Jamie:** Maybe. Title: *Everything Will Be Okay*.  
**Alex:** Perfect.  
**Jamie:** And remember, when dread feels tragic and wooden, whisper, “There’s no need to worry—we’ll figure this out.”  
**Alex:** Deal. I promise when next panic strikes, I’ll ring you.  
**Jamie:** I’m not going to let you give up, ever.  
*(They sit in comfortable silence as the river glows copper.)*  

---

## Scene 24 – Producers’ office, Monday morning, two days after the triumphant review
**Producer Leila:** Alex, congratulations. New York loved you, so **why don’t you take the show on a five‑city tour**?  
**Alex:** A tour? That sounds dreadful—in the best sense—but huge.  
**Leila:** If I were you, I would **lock the dates today** before another venue grabs the slot.  
**Alex:** You ought to know my anxiety spikes when travel’s involved.  
**Jamie:** Hey, cheer up—you look really tense. There’s no need to worry; we’ll figure this out city by city.  
**Leila:** Exactly. And you’d better pick an assistant stage‑manager; the road can be quirky.  
**Alex:** What do you think, Taylor?  
**Taylor:** I completely agree with everything Leila’s said. A tour keeps momentum.  
**Alex:** I wasn’t sure at first, but now I’m with you. Okay—let’s do it.  

---

## Scene 25 – Quiet diner booth, that evening
**Alex:** Five cities. Five new houses staring at me.  
**Jamie:** Don’t blame yourself for feeling scared. But you shouldn’t give up this chance.  
**Alex:** If I bomb even one night …  
**Jamie:** I’m not going to let you give up. Besides, you should **treat each stop like a fresh experiment**.  
**Alex:** Same opinion that Dr Rowan will have, I bet.  
*(Phone buzzes.)*  
**Text – Dr Rowan:** “Proud. Remember: growth = outside comfort zone.”  
**Alex:** See? He agrees already.  

---

## Scene 26 – University lab, next day
**Mia:** *[lab goggles on]* Tour? That’s brilliant. Meanwhile I’ve been offered to present my copper‑catalysed reaction poster in Berlin—if funding appears.  
**Jamie:** Why don’t you **apply for the young‑researcher grant**?  
**Mia:** If I were you I’d skip hope—the grant success rate is 8 %.  
**Dr Rowan:** Ought to apply anyway. It’s like auditions: numbers look dreadful, outcomes can be clever.  
**Mia:** I completely agree … reluctantly. Fine, I’ll draft the proposal.  
**Alex:** Good. Everything will be okay—and I’ll tour Europe next year, cheer from the wings.  

---

## Scene 27 – Tour rehearsal hall, first day
**Sam (tour director):** Folks, new city = new stage geography. Alex, you’d better **adjust your cross down‑right** after the cockroach line.  
**Alex:** It feels wooden on the diagonal.  
**Sam:** Would be better to **hit the mark and pivot slowly**; sightlines favour that.  
**Jamie:** If I were you, I would **re‑block with sticky tape tonight**.  
**Alex:** Why don’t you help me tape the floor?  
**Jamie:** Already grabbed neon gaffer. Cheer up.  

---

## Scene 28 – Mia’s dorm, late night grant‑writing
**Mia:** My introduction’s tragic. Dreadful clichés everywhere.  
**Dr Rowan:** You should **start with a story about cadmium pollution**—hook reviewers emotionally.  
**Mia:** Same opinion that my advisor keeps pushing. I wasn’t sure at first but now I’m with you.  
**Dr Rowan:** I totally agree with everything you’ve said about tight storytelling.  
**Mia:** Okay. If I were you I’d skip extra adjectives, too.  

---

## Scene 29 – Tour stop #1: Chicago, backstage fifteen minutes to curtain
**Alex:** New theatre smell—creepy and exciting.  
**Jamie:** Why don’t you **run the lantern contingency once**, in case the power flickers again?  
**Alex:** Good call.  
**Taylor:** Also, you’d better **check the cockroach prop**—yesterday someone swapped it for a rubber lizard as a prank.  
**Alex:** Dreadful.  
**Jamie:** Cheer up; lizard won’t show tonight.  
*(House lights flash.)*  
**Stage Manager:** Places!  
**Alex:** Everything will be okay. Let’s crawl.

---

## Scene 31 – Detroit hotel lobby, 2 a.m.
**Alex:** *[voice‑note]* Couldn’t sleep. The theatre tomorrow seats two thousand; dread rising.

---

## Scene 32 – Detroit stage, mid‑performance
*(Audience unusually loud—candy wrappers, coughs. Alex’s focus wavers.)*  
**Alex (inner):** Wooden delivery creeping in. If I were Jamie I’d skip panicking.  
*(He steadies, slows, lands final tableau. Polite applause.)*  
**Taylor:** That was tough, but you salvaged it.  
**Alex:** It didn’t lack originality, but energy?  
**Jamie:** Ooh, that’s too bad. Everything will be fine—rough houses happen.  
**Alex:** Don’t blame yourself. I promise next city will soar.  

---

## Scene 33 – Denver airport, delay chaos
**PA System:** Flight cancelled.  
**Jamie:** Dreadful.  
**Alex:** Sentimental part of me likes trains. Could we?  
**Taylor:** Quirky idea, but off‑schedule. You ought to **reroute through Dallas** instead.  
**Alex:** If I were you I’d skip further stress and take the overnight sleeper, read lines.  
**Jamie:** Same opinion that—train adventure!  
**Taylor:** Fine. Let’s ride steel rails.  

---

## Scene 34 – Night train observation car
**Jamie:** Stars over Nebraska—creepy how empty the plains feel.

**Alex:** I totally agree. Everything will be okay—better than okay.  

---

## Scene 36 – Tour stop #3: Seattle, tech rehearsal
**Sam:** Rain drum noise might mask your whispered line. You’d better **lean into mic pack channel B**.  
**Alex:** What if it pops?  
**Jamie:** Don’t worry; spare lav on standby.  
**Sam:** And if the generator hum creeps in, why don’t you **pause a half‑beat longer**—silence reads intentional.  
**Alex:** Clever. Same opinion that we keep contingency.  

---

## Scene 37 – Seattle post‑show Q&A
**Audience Member:** Why a cockroach?  
**Alex:** Cockroaches survive anything—a tragic but hopeful metaphor. If I were you, I’d skip despair at apocalypse scenarios; resilience matters.

---

**Alex:** Indeed. Everything will be okay—whatever shape the story takes.  

---

## Scene 40 – Roof‑terrace after‑party, overlooking Hollywood lights
**Jamie:** Remember when you panicked about the first audition?  
**Alex:** I was wrong; you were right about everything.  
**Jamie:** Not everything—you were right to keep the cockroach.  
**Alex:** Dreadful, sentimental, quirky, wooden, tragic, clever, creepy—all adjectives critics used, yet it works.  
**Jamie:** Same opinion that art needs contradictions.  
**Alex:** Promise me, if success warps my brain, you’ll drag me back to sanity.
