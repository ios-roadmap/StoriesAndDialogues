*Anxiety meets resilience in the glow of unlikely friendship.*

## Scene 1 – Back-stage corridor, 30 min before auditions

**Alex** *(pacing, breath shallow)*: Every sentence feels like sawdust in my mouth.
**Jamie** *(blocks the corridor)*: Breathe. Mark your three emotional peaks, then **shut up between them**—silence is punctuation.
**Alex**: Easy advice; hard execution. My hands are shaking.
**Jamie**: Let them. Shaking hands are honest; honesty is magnetic.
**Alex** *(half-laugh)*: Magnetic splinters?
**Jamie**: Splinters catch light. Trust the splinters.
**Alex**: And if I blank?
**Jamie**: Then you stand there, stare into the void, and let the void blink first.
**Alex** *(straightens)*: Right. Void, meet actor.

## Scene 2 – Main stage, lights cooling after Alex’s read

**Taylor** *(director, clapping once)*: You trimmed three beats. The grief landed like a body-blow.
**Alex** *(low voice to Jamie)*: I trimmed them by mistake.
**Jamie**: Your mistake is now a technique—own it.
**Taylor**: Do that pause again tonight. The hush felt dangerous.
**Alex**: Dangerous good or dangerous “fire hazard”?
**Taylor** *(grins)*: Good. The house leaned in; I heard forty people stop chewing gum.

## Scene 3 – Street-corner café, dusk

**Mia** *(buried in index cards)*: Chemistry final tomorrow—panic rating: hurricane.
**Alex**: Hurricane prep step one: sleep.
**Mia**: Sleep is for mammals without 48 % finals.
**Dr Rowan** *(suddenly appears with tea)*: Hippocampal consolidation *requires* sleep, Ms Mammal.
**Mia**: Six hours?
**Dr Rowan**: Eight.
**Mia** *(sighs)*: Seven.
**Jamie**: Bargained like a pro. Close the books by ten, I’ll text a lullaby.

## Scene 4 – Park bench, next morning, early sun

**Jamie** *(waving paper bag)*: Pastry delivery for the newly validated.
**Alex** *(takes croissant)*: Taylor loved my accidental pauses. I feel tall.
**Jamie**: Good. Remember the feeling—write it on your arm if you must.
**Alex**: My arm’s full of fear scribbles.
**Jamie**: Fear scribbles erase with sweat. Pride ink is permanent marker.
**Alex** *(nods)*: Permanent it is.

## Scene 5 – Community-theatre stage, first full rehearsal

**Taylor**: New soliloquy. The cockroach stays; self-pity goes.
**Alex** *(reading)*: “A lantern hums louder than memory.” How do I make that hopeful?
**Jamie** *(side-coach)*: Whisper the line, then look up as if the light revealed a doorway.
**Alex**: Whisper, look, doorway—got it.
**Taylor**: Do it once. *(Alex performs)*
**Taylor**: That look—keep it. The audience will follow your eyes out of the dark.

## Scene 6 – Rooftop, night before showcase taping

**Riley** *(agent, notebook open)*: Festival programmers devour irony—give them a wink on “cockroach.”
**Alex**: A tragic wink?
**Jamie**: Half-smile, like you’re sharing an inside joke with mortality.
**Riley**: Exactly. Then crush them with the last sentence.
**Alex**: Inside joke with mortality—adding to notes.
**Jamie**: Add nothing. Feel it; winks hate choreography.

## Scene 7 – Recording studio, showcase day

*(Take 1 completes; red light snuffs)*
**Camera Op**: Clean audio, zero pops.
**Riley** *(pumps fist)*: The hush after the wink is gold. We stop here.
**Alex** *(finally breathes)*: One-take wonder—unexpected.
**Jamie**: Expect excellence, save surprise for cake.
**Alex**: Cake later. Oxygen now.

## Scene 8 – University quad, results pinned

**Mia** *(shouting)*: Eighty-three percent!
**Dr Rowan**: The hippocampus applauds.
**Mia**: Coffee on me—after REM nap.
**Alex**: Proud brother noise!
**Jamie**: Noise accepted. Pastries joining coffee.

---

## Scene 9 – Theatre lobby, opening night, house open

**Alex** *(peeking through curtain)*: Critics, ex-classmates, my mum—pressure stew.
**Jamie**: Perform for the lantern, not the stew.
**Alex**: Lantern can’t write reviews.
**Jamie**: It writes silence; silence shapes reviews.
*(Stage Manager): Five minutes to places!*
**Alex** *(inhales)*: Lantern first, stew later.

---

## Scene 10 – Final tableau, performance climax

*(Air tightens. Applause detonates as lights snap to black.)*

---

## Scene 11 – Newspaper stand, dawn drizzle

**Alex** *(reading)*: “Lantern, Cockroach, and the Art of Paused Fear.” Front page of Arts.

**Alex**: Mum will cry.
**Jamie**: Good tears fertilise pride.

## Scene 12 – Producer’s office, a week later

**Leila**: Off-Broadway said six weeks. Touring houses circling.
**Alex** *(pulse spikes)*: Airports, broken sleep, strangers—terror cocktail.
**Jamie**: Terror is adrenaline unemployed. Give it a job on stage.
**Leila**: Sign here, job contract for your terror.
**Alex** *(signs)*: Terror hired.

## Scene 13 – Off-Broadway preview, mid-show blackout

*(Power dies. Alex lights prop lantern.)*
**Alex** *(raises flame)*: “Darkness only edits what we fear to say.”
*(Audience silent, spellbound.)*
**Jamie** *(whisper from wings)*: Own the void again, mate.
*(Generators kick; applause erupts even before scene ends.)*

## Scene 14 – Beach at dawn, months later

**Alex** *(watching sunrise)*: Corridor panic feels like another lifetime.
**Jamie**: Panic is seasonal. Courage migrates with it.
**Alex**: When the season turns again?
**Jamie** *(hands him small flashlight)*: Backup lantern. Batteries included.
**Alex** *(smiles)*: And the cockroach?
**Jamie**: Somewhere under the boardwalk, plotting sequels.

### Moral

When fear scuttles in, raise the light; resilience will know where to stand.
